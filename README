At http://piotrnowicki.com/2011/03/jee-6-scwcd-mock-questions/ you can find "Oracle Certified Expert JSP and Servlets 
Mock Exam" I've authored. I've decided to add source code examples to some of these questions. 

I hope it'll help you to understand and test by yourself how a Servlet container will react in particular situations.
If you find some error, would like to change the example or introduce another question with some interesting feature, 
feel free to fork it and I'll be happy to add it to the main exam.

Some of the code examples come with *.class files of the source files. It's because I assumed that some of you would 
prefer just to put the code in your servlet container and watch it in action right away.

Have fun and good luck :-)
